<h2>For this project..</h2>
<p>I wanted to attract the users by placing a simple mini-game using JavaScript on the home page. I searched for examples I could use, and I found <a href=””>this example</a>. I chose the codes because the syntax in this game was simple enough for me to use.<br><br>
    The user starts the game by pressing the play button. Press the button to find the emoji, and when user finds it, the game ends. For each game, the location of emoji is randomly placed.<br><br>
    The game was interesting, but I wanted to add a click animation to this in order to bring more interest to the users. I searched and liked what I found from mo.js that is simple to use. I added the animation to the project.<br><br>
    There is one new challenge in this project. This is my first time using scss to my project. When looking at examples of others in codepen, they were often using mixin and variable using scss. I wanted to use it too. It took a while to understand the syntax, but it was worth it. It was very convenient especially when organizing animations.</p>

<h2>References</h2>
<p>I referenced the game from <a href="https://codepen.io/ilithya/pen/vodGee">ilithya</a><br>The click effect is brought from <a href="https://mojs.github.io/tutorials/shape-swirl/#tune">mo.js</a></p>

<h2>Code Highlights</h2>
<h3>Js codes for game</h3>
<p class="codes">const getRandomIntInclusive = maxNum => {<br>
&emsp;const min = 0;<br>
&emsp;const max = Math.floor(maxNum);<br>

&emsp;return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;<br>
};</p>
<p>This is the codes for the game that set emoji to be placed randomly. It uses the Math method. </p>
<h3>Click animation using mo.js.</h3>
<p class="codes">document.addEventListener( 'click', function (e) {<br><br>

        circle1<br>
            .tune({ x: e.pageX, y: e.pageY  })<br>
            .replay();<br><br>
        
        circle2<br>
            .tune({ x: e.pageX, y: e.pageY  })<br>
            .replay();<br><br>
        
        });</p>
<p>This is for the click animation. I brought this codes from mo.js example. You can add some interactivity with tune method regarding user input.</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>I searched for various examples to do this project, and I saw many people were writing their codes in scss. In order to use their example, it was necessary to get used to the scss. Their code was very neat and simple, so I thought I wanted to use it too. I looked at the codepen and scss guide page, and it was helpful for me to understand the syntax of the scss.<br><br>
    For example, in many examples, people used the variables to colors and fonts. I followed their ways and It was very convenient! Once I set the color at the beginning of the scss document as var, I could change the color that has the same value easily just changing the value of the var.
    The nesting function made my coding easy as well. This function is especially useful when I want to add effects such as hover. I set the &:hover selector in the bracket of the element that I want to set the hover, and it made the codes more shorten and easy to read.<br><br>
