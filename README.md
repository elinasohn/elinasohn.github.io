Lab: Assessing Javascript Libraries

Usability - how will the library functionality clearly help your users?

File Size (Weight) - what is the file size of the library?

Dependences - how much do required libraries add to its size?

Functionality/Reusability - how well do its features match your need?

Robust - in which browsers and versions does it work?

Performance (CPU, memory, network) - does it lag on desktop or mobile browsers?

Maturity - how long has it been around?

Ongoing development - when was its latest update? how is it supported ($$$)?

License - which license does the library use?

Supportive community - how many people use it?

Documentation quality - consider both quantity and quality

Developer support tools - can you write your own customize functions to extend it?
