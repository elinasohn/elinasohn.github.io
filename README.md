# Lab: Assessing Javascript Libraries
The library that I choose is <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a>. It stands for Date-Driven Documents, which is a JavaScript library that visualizes documents dynamically and interactively based on data. It makes use of SVG, HTML5, and CSS standards. You can use it to create conventional charts such as bar, line, and even more complex charts.

npm d3 URL: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3">https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3</a><br>
Demo page: <a href="demo.html">demo.html</a>

The other one chosen for comparison is <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a>. Chart.js has not as many visualizations as D3.js, but it is easy to use. If you need only basic graphs such as bar, line, and pie, then Chart.js would be a great choice.

## Usability - how will the library functionality clearly help your users?
Both D3 and Chart.js will make data more understandable to users with visualizations.

## File Size (Weight) - what is the file size of the library?
The unpacked size of D3.js is 924KB. Chart.js is 1.41MB, so it is more bigger than D3.

## Dependences - how much do required libraries add to its size?
D3.js has 31 dependencies such as d3-array, d3-axis, d3-brush and d3-collection. It also has 7 dev-dependencies.
Chart.js has 2 dependencies named chartjs-color and moment. It has 32 dev dependencies.

## Functionality/Reusability - how well do its features match your need?
D3 is the library for creating and manipulating SVG and HTML. It provides tools to help the developer visualize their data. On the other hand, Chart.js is based on canvas and only provides few types of chart. 
I haven't decide yet what type of graph I draw, so I don't know which one would be great for my need.
If I'd like to make interactive visualizions with various types of graph, then D3 would be a good fit.
To make simple graph in a timely manner, chart.js would be great choice.

## Robust - in which browsers and versions does it work?
D3 5+ supports recent browsers, such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari.
D3 4 and below also supports IE 9+. Parts of D3 may work in older browsers, as many D3 modules have minimal requirements.

Chart.js supports the browsers where canvas is supported. Most earlier version options have current equivalents or are the same.

## Performance (CPU, memory, network) - does it lag on desktop or mobile browsers?
D3.js seems to work well on all devices without lag.
Chart.js also is rendered quite fast on all devices.

## Maturity - how long has it been around?
The initial release of D3 was February 18, 2011; about 9 years ago. There has been a steady update since then until now.

Chart.js was released on Jul, 2014, and it also has been updated until now.

## Ongoing development - when was its latest update? how is it supported ($$$)?
Its latest commit of D3 was April 20. The previous commit was on April 1, so it seem to be updating steadily.

Chart.js it also actively being developed. Its latest commit was on 6 hours ago as of today, May 28.

## License - which license does the library use?
D3 has BSD license, so it allows to use both private and commercial. Here's more detailed descriptions for the license. <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">BDS license</a>

## Supportive community - how many people use it?
When I enter the git page of D3, there's 90,470 repositories that are used by. Also, there's 91.7k stars and it forked 22.1k times. 

## Documentation quality - consider both quantity and quality

## Developer support tools - can you write your own customize functions to extend it?
D3.js: Yes, they seems that I could. There's 121 contributors.
Chart.js:
