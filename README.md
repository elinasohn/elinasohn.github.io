# Lab: Assessing Javascript Libraries
The library that I choose is <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a>. It stands for Date-Driven Documents, which is a JavaScript library that visualizes documents dynamically and interactively based on data. It makes use of SVG, HTML5, and CSS standards. 

## Usability - how will the library functionality clearly help your users?

## File Size (Weight) - what is the file size of the library?

## Dependences - how much do required libraries add to its size?

## Functionality/Reusability - how well do its features match your need?

## Robust - in which browsers and versions does it work?

## Performance (CPU, memory, network) - does it lag on desktop or mobile browsers?

## Maturity - how long has it been around?

## Ongoing development - when was its latest update? how is it supported ($$$)?

## License - which license does the library use?

## Supportive community - how many people use it?

## Documentation quality - consider both quantity and quality

## Developer support tools - can you write your own customize functions to extend it?
